# C++ primitive libraries

ROCm template libraries for algorithms are as follows:

:::::{grid} 1 1 3 3
:gutter: 1

:::{grid-item-card} {doc}`rocPRIM <rocprim:index>`

rocPRIM is an AMD GPU optimized template library of algorithm primitives, like
transforms, reductions, scans, etc. It also serves as a common back-end for
similar libraries found inside ROCm.

:::{grid-item-card} {doc}`rocThrust <rocthrust:index>`

rocThrust is a template library of algorithm primitives with a Thrust-compatible
interface. Their CPU back-ends are identical, while the GPU back-end calls into
rocPRIM.

:::{grid-item-card} {doc}`hipCUB <hipcub:index>`

hipCUB is a template library of algorithm primitives with a CUB-compatible
interface. It's back-end is rocPRIM.

:::

:::{grid-item-card} {doc}`hipTensor <hiptensor:index>`

hipTensor is AMD's C++ library for accelerating tensor primitives
based on the composable kernel library,
through general purpose kernel languages, like HIP C++.
