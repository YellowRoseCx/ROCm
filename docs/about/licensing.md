## Package licensing

```{attention}
AQL Profiler and AOCC CPU optimization are both provided in binary form, each
subject to the license agreement enclosed in the directory for the binary and is
available here: `/opt/rocm/share/doc/rocm-llvm-alt/EULA`. By using, installing,
copying or distributing AQL Profiler and/or AOCC CPU Optimizations, you agree to
the terms and conditions of this license agreement. If you do not agree to the
terms of this agreement, do not install, copy or use the AQL Profiler and/or the
AOCC CPU Optimizations.
```

For the rest of the ROCm packages, you can find the licensing information at the
following location: `/opt/rocm/share/doc/<component-name>/`

For example, you can fetch the licensing information of the `_amd_comgr_`
component (Code Object Manager) from the `amd_comgr` folder. A file named
`LICENSE.txt` contains the license details at:
`/opt/rocm-5.4.3/share/doc/amd_comgr/LICENSE.txt`
