The steps to uninstall the HIP SDK for Windows are described in this document.

## Uninstallation

All components, except visual studio plug-in should be uninstalled through
control panel -> Add/Remove Program. For visual studio extension uninstallation,

Uninstallation of the HIP SDK components can be done through the Windows
Settings app. Navigate to "Apps > Installed apps", click the "..." on the far
