# Tuning guides

Use case-specific system setup and tuning guides.

## High-performance computing

High-performance computing (HPC) workloads have unique requirements. The default
hardware and BIOS configurations for OEM platforms may not provide optimal
performance for HPC workloads. To enable optimal HPC settings on a per-platform
and per-workload level, this guide calls out:

* BIOS settings that can impact performance
* Hardware configuration best practices
* Supported versions of operating systems
* Workload-specific recommendations for optimal BIOS and operating system
  settings

There is also a discussion on the AMD Instinct™ software development
environment, including information on how to install and run the DGEMM, STREAM,
HPCG, and HPL benchmarks. This guidance provides a good starting point but is
not exhaustively tested across all compilers.

Prerequisites to understanding this document and to performing tuning of HPC
applications include:

* Experience in configuring servers
* Administrative access to the server's Management Interface (BMC)
* Administrative access to the operating system
* Familiarity with the OEM server's BMC (strongly recommended)
* Familiarity with the OS specific tools for configuration, monitoring, and
  troubleshooting (strongly recommended)

This document provides guidance on tuning systems with various AMD Instinct™
accelerators for HPC workloads. This document is not an all-inclusive guide, and
some items referred to may have similar, but different, names in various OEM
systems (for example, OEM-specific BIOS settings). This document also provides
suggestions on items that should be the initial focus of additional,
application-specific tuning.

This document is based on the AMD EPYC™ 7003-series processor family (former
codename "Milan").

While this guide is a good starting point, developers are encouraged to perform
their own performance testing for additional tuning.

**[AMD Instinct™ MI100](./mi100)**

This chapter briefly reviews hardware aspects of the AMD Instinct™ MI100
accelerators and the CDNA™ 1 architecture that is the foundation of these GPUs.

## Workstation

Workstation workloads, much like high-performance computing, have a unique set of
requirements, a blend of both graphics and compute, certification, stability and
the list continues.

The document covers specific software requirements and processes needed to use
these GPUs for Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV) and machine learning
(ML).

The main purpose of this document is to help users utilize the RDNA 2 GPUs to
their full potential.
