### Changes in this release

#### Ubuntu 18.04 end-of-life announcement

Support for Ubuntu 18.04 ends in this release. Future releases of ROCm will not provide prebuilt packages for Ubuntu 18.04.
HIP and Other Runtimes

#### HIP Runtime

##### Fixes

* A bug was discovered in the HIP graph capture implementation in the ROCm v5.2.0 release. If the same kernel is called twice (with different argument values) in a graph capture, the implementation only kept the argument values for the second kernel call.

* A bug was introduced in the hiprtc implementation in the ROCm v5.2.0 release. This bug caused the `hiprtcGetLoweredName` call to fail for named expressions with whitespace in it.

Example:

The named expression `my_sqrt<complex<double>>` passed but `my_sqrt<complex<double >>` failed.
ROCm Libraries

#### RCCL

##### Added

Compatibility with NCCL 2.12.10

* Packages for test and benchmark executables on all supported OSes using CPack

* Added custom signal handler - opt-in with RCCL_ENABLE_SIGNALHANDLER=1

  * Additional details provided if Binary File Descriptor library (BFD) is pre-installed.

* Added experimental support for using multiple ranks per device

  * Requires using a new interface to create communicator (ncclCommInitRankMulti), refer to the interface documentation for details.

  * To avoid potential deadlocks, user might have to set an environment variables increasing    the number of hardware queues. For example,

```sh
export GPU_MAX_HW_QUEUES=16
```

* Added support for reusing ports in NET/IB channels

  * Opt-in with NCCL_IB_SOCK_CLIENT_PORT_REUSE=1 and NCCL_IB_SOCK_SERVER_PORT_REUSE=1

  * When "Call to bind failed: Address already in use" error happens in large-scale AlltoAll(for example, >=64 MI200 nodes), users are suggested to opt-in either one or both of the options to resolve the massive port usage issue

  * Avoid using NCCL_IB_SOCK_SERVER_PORT_REUSE when NCCL_NCHANNELS_PER_NET_PEER is tuned >1

##### Removed

* Removed experimental clique-based kernels
