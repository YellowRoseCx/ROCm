### What's new in this release

#### HIP enhancements

The ROCm v5.0 release consists of the following HIP enhancements.

##### HIP installation guide updates

The HIP Installation Guide is updated to include building HIP from source on the NVIDIA platform.

Refer to the HIP Installation Guide v5.0 for more details.

##### Managed memory allocation

Managed memory, including the `__managed__` keyword, is now supported in the HIP combined host/device compilation. Through unified memory allocation, managed memory allows data to be shared and accessible to both the CPU and GPU using a single pointer. The allocation is managed by the AMD GPU driver using the Linux Heterogeneous Memory Management (HMM) mechanism. The user can call managed memory API hipMallocManaged to allocate a large chunk of HMM memory, execute kernels on a device, and fetch data between the host and device as needed.

> **Note**
>
> In a HIP application,  it is recommended to do a capability check before calling the managed memory APIs. For example,
>
> ```cpp
> int managed_memory = 0;
> HIPCHECK(hipDeviceGetAttribute(&managed_memory,
>   hipDeviceAttributeManagedMemory,p_gpuDevice));
> if (!managed_memory ) {
>   printf ("info: managed memory access not supported on the device %d\n Skipped\n", p_gpuDevice);
> }
> else {
>   HIPCHECK(hipSetDevice(p_gpuDevice));
>   HIPCHECK(hipMallocManaged(&Hmm, N * sizeof(T)));
> . . .
> }
> ```

> **Note**
>
> The managed memory capability check may not be necessary; however, if HMM is not supported, managed malloc will fall back to using system memory. Other managed memory API calls will, then, have

Refer to the HIP API documentation for more details on managed memory APIs.

#### New environment variable

The following new environment variable is added in this release:

| Environment Variable | Value                 | Description |
|----------------------|-----------------------|-------------|
| HSA_COOP_CU_COUNT    | 0 or 1 (default is 0) | Some processors support more CUs than can reliably be used in a cooperative dispatch. Setting the environment variable HSA_COOP_CU_COUNT to 1 will cause ROCr to return the correct CU count for cooperative groups through the HSA_AMD_AGENT_INFO_COOPERATIVE_COMPUTE_UNIT_COUNT attribute of hsa_agent_get_info(). Setting HSA_COOP_CU_COUNT to other values, or leaving it unset, will cause ROCr to return the same CU count for the attributes HSA_AMD_AGENT_INFO_COOPERATIVE_COMPUTE_UNIT_COUNT and HSA_AMD_AGENT_INFO_COMPUTE_UNIT_COUNT. Future ROCm releases will make HSA_COOP_CU_COUNT=1 the default. |

### Breaking changes

#### Runtime breaking change

Re-ordering of the enumerated type in hip_runtime_api.h to better match NV.  See below for the difference in enumerated types.

ROCm software will be affected if any of the defined enums listed below are used in the code.  Applications built with ROCm v5.0 enumerated types will work with a ROCm 4.5.2 driver. However, an undefined behavior error will occur with a ROCm v4.5.2 application that uses these enumerated types with a ROCm 5.0 runtime.

### Known issues

#### Incorrect dGPU behavior when using AMDVBFlash tool

The AMDVBFlash tool, used for flashing the VBIOS image to dGPU, does not communicate with the ROM Controller specifically when the driver is present. This is because the driver, as part of its runtime power management feature, puts the dGPU to a sleep state.

As a workaround, users can run amdgpu.runpm=0, which temporarily disables the runtime power management feature from the driver and dynamically changes some power control-related sysfs files.

#### Issue with START timestamp in ROCProfiler

Users may encounter an issue with the enabled timestamp functionality for monitoring one or multiple counters. ROCProfiler outputs the following four timestamps for each kernel:

* Dispatch
* Start
* End
* Complete

##### Issue

This defect is related to the Start timestamp functionality, which incorrectly shows an earlier time than the Dispatch timestamp.

To reproduce the issue,

1. Enable timing using the --timestamp on flag.

2. Use the -i option with the input filename that contains the name of the counter(s) to monitor.

3. Run the program.

4. Check the output result file.

##### Current behavior

BeginNS is lower than DispatchNS, which is incorrect.

##### Expected behavior

The correct order is:

Dispatch < Start < End < Complete

Users cannot use ROCProfiler to measure the time spent on each kernel because of the incorrect timestamp with counter collection enabled.

##### Recommended workaround

Users are recommended to collect kernel execution timestamps without monitoring counters, as follows:

1. ​Enable timing using the --timestamp on flag, and run the application.

2. Rerun the application using the -i option with the input filename that contains the name of the counter(s) to monitor, and save this to a different output file using the -o flag.

3. Check the output result file from step 1.

4. The order of timestamps correctly displays as:
  DispatchNS < BeginNS < EndNS < CompleteNS

5. Users can find the values of the collected counters in the output file generated in step 2.

#### Radeon Pro V620 and W6800 workstation GPUs

##### No support for SMI and ROCDebugger on SRIOV

System Management Interface (SMI) and ROCDebugger are not supported in the SRIOV environment on any GPU. For more information, refer to the Systems Management Interface documentation.

### Deprecations and warnings

#### ROCm libraries changes – deprecations and deprecation removal

* The hipFFT.h header is now provided only by the hipFFT package.  Up to ROCm 5.0, users would get hipFFT.h in the rocFFT package too.

* The GlobalPairwiseAMG class is now entirely removed, users should use the PairwiseAMG class instead.

* The rocsparse_spmm signature in 5.0 was changed to match that of rocsparse_spmm_ex.  In 5.0, rocsparse_spmm_ex is still present, but deprecated. Signature diff for rocsparse_spmm

#### HIP API deprecations and warnings

##### Warning - arithmetic operators of HIP complex and vector types

In this release, arithmetic operators of HIP complex and vector types are deprecated.

* As alternatives to arithmetic operators of HIP complex types, users can use arithmetic operators of `std::complex` types.

* As alternatives to arithmetic operators of HIP vector types, users can use the operators of the native clang vector type associated with the data member of HIP vector types.

During the deprecation, two macros `_HIP_ENABLE_COMPLEX_OPERATORS` and `_HIP_ENABLE_VECTOR_OPERATORS` are provided to allow users to conditionally enable arithmetic operators of HIP complex or vector types.

Note, the two macros are mutually exclusive and, by default, set to Off.

The arithmetic operators of HIP complex and vector types will be removed in a future release.

Refer to the HIP API Guide for more information.

#### Warning - compiler-generated code object version 4 deprecation

Support for loading compiler-generated code object version 4 will be deprecated in a future release with no release announcement and replaced with code object 5 as the default version.

The current default is code object version 4.

#### Warning - MIOpenTensile deprecation

MIOpenTensile will be deprecated in a future release.
